import React from "react";

const About: React.FC = () => {
  throw new Error();

  return (
    <section className="about-wrapper">
      <p>
        You also need to set the: body background-color: #yourcolor in the styles.css
        It worked for me last time I tried, but remember to fill up the manifest.webmanifest with this information as well
      </p>
    </section>
  )
}

export default About;
